React is a framework for building user interfaces
React is Composable
React helps in Code Reusability
React creates Single Page Applications effectively

MPA - Multipage application - Reloads whole page when user interacts with the app
SPA - Single Page application - Loads only one HTML document and parts of document is updated using Javascript API's

React is a declarative language. 


DOM - Document Object Model
Virtual DOM - 
Copy of DOM React keep in memory. Whenever we make any change, it will not change the Real DOM, it will change only the Virtual DOM.
Later the changes will be reflected back to real DOM. Only the changes will be rerendered, not the whole tree.

JSX - Javascript + HTML
Babel is a compiler which converts JSX to Javascript


Component - Whole UI can be splitted into Components. We can declare components by two ways. Functional Components and Class based Components

Named export - Can export any number of things, import with curly bracket
Default export - Can export only one thing, Import without curly bracket

State - Any change in the state re-render the UI

Reconciliation - Finding difference between real dom and virtual dom
and determining which part to be changed.

Props - It is a object that is passed to component
